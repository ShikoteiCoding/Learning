# Data Structures & Algorithm in Python

Main goal is to manipulate standard libraries and limit test built-ins functionalities. Data Structure is a focus in python as the simplicity of the languages allows for focus over OOP.

## Commands
Compile command (using virtual env in root folder /venv/)
```
python3 filename.py
```

## Development Plan
Go from arrays to graph structures. Then move towards algorithms on those structures.
