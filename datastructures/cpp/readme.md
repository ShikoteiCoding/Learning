# Data Structures & Algorithm in Cpp

Resolving problems from Leetcode. Main goal is to manipulate standard libraries and limit test built-ins functionalities.

## Commands
Compile command
```
g++ -std=c++11 -o problem.o problem.cpp
```

Execution command
```
./problem.cpp
```

## Development Plan
Solving the first 100 problems starting from the easiest to hardest (by leetcode categorisation).
